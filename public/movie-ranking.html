<h1>The best movies according to Tiede</h1>
<h2>My Top-3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Simply a classic. Good adaptation from Michael Crichtons best-selling book.</p>
<h3>Saving privat Ryan</h3>
<p>Very realistic and saddening war movie. There are no real heroes here.</p>
<h3>Django unchained</h3>
<p>Very good movie about slaverie and a male slave being freeed and becoming his own master as a headhunter.</p>
